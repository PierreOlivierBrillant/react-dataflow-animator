/**
 * Custom icon registries — the framework-free replacement for the React
 * `registerNodeIcon` / `registerSubIcon`, whose extension point took a
 * `ReactNode` and therefore could not live in core.
 *
 * An icon is either **SVG markup** (the common case, and what the README's
 * examples already looked like) or a **factory** returning a fresh `SVGElement`
 * (for anything that has to vary).
 *
 * SSR-safe: registering never touches the DOM. A consumer may legitimately call
 * `registerNodeIcon` at module scope in a bundle that also runs on the server,
 * so markup is parsed lazily, on the first resolution — which only happens
 * while rendering, and rendering only happens in the browser.
