/**
 * The convergence loop that stands in for React's render/measure fixed point.
 *
 * `Stage` + `useStageGeometry` form the iteration `Gₙ₊₁ = measure(render(Gₙ))`,
 * terminated by `sameGeometry` returning the previous object identity — React
 * then bails out of re-rendering, so nothing re-measures. `mountVanillaStage` is
 * a single imperative call, so it has to run that iteration itself and, above
 * all, know when to stop.
 *
 * The subtlety worth stating plainly: React's iteration is BUDGETED, not
 * unbounded. `useStageGeometry`'s layout effect performs one synchronous
 * `measure()` plus three more across `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks, and for a
 * non-circuit diagram nothing else ever calls `measure` again (`Stage`'s
 * letterbox and pin-nudge effects are both guarded and inert when
 * `frameAspect === 0`). A plain left-to-right demo therefore performs exactly
 * four measurements and then renders whatever it has — converged or not.
 *
 * That is why `maxPasses` is a faithfulness parameter rather than a safety
 * valve. If React stops at four, a vanilla renderer that kept iterating to the
 * true fixed point would legitimately draw something ELSE, and the pixel gate
 * would be right to fail it. Matching the picture means matching the budget.
