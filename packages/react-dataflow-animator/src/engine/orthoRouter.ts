/**
 * Global orthogonal wire router for schematic (`direction: 'circuit'`) diagrams.
 *
 * By default every wire is drawn as strictly HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL segments
 * that:
 *   • never cross a component body (hard obstacle avoidance, all obstacles);
 *   • leave/enter a terminal PERPENDICULAR to its face (the pin normal);
 *   • keep a straight lead ({@link PIN_LEAD} px) out of / into a hard connector
 *     before the first / last turn, so a wire never bends flush against a pin;
 *   • take as few corners as possible (a turn is penalised);
 *   • do NOT run on top of a parallel wire — two wires may only meet where they
 *     cross at a right angle (lane separation).
 *
 * It routes on a Hanan-style grid (lines through every pin and every obstacle
 * edge, plus intermediate lane tracks in the gaps) with an A* per wire. Wires
 * are routed in order; each marks the grid edges it used, and later wires pay a
 * penalty to reuse a segment in the SAME orientation — so parallels spread onto
 * neighbouring tracks. A perpendicular crossing is allowed (the wires meet at a
 * right angle) but not free: it is priced at {@link CROSS_DETOUR} px of length
 * inside the wire's `hard` cost (see {@link RouteCost}), so a later wire pays a
 * SHORT detour to dodge an earlier one — but never a corner.
 *
 * A wire may opt into `diagonal` (octilinear, only 45 / 135 / 225 / 315°). It is
 * routed in two tiers, each collision-checked so a diagonal is never a
 * regression:
 *   1. a direct {@link octilinearElbow} — one bold 45° diagonal centred between
 *      the two pin stubs, so a feedback pair reads as a single crossing (the
 *      SR-latch X) instead of a tight dogleg;
 *   2. failing that, the orthogonal A* route with its corners mitered into 45°
 *      segments by {@link diagonalize} (long L-shapes and staircases collapse
 *      into clean diagonal runs; a short perpendicular stub is kept at each pin).
 * Obstacle avoidance and lane separation are still decided on the orthogonal
 * skeleton, so neither tier re-introduces a crossing.

/**
 * The A* cost is LEXICOGRAPHIC, not a single sum. Each explored state carries a
 * three-key cost {@link RouteCost} compared in this strict order:
 *
 *   1. `hard`  = length + turns ({@link TURN_COST}) + lane separation
 *                ({@link LANE_COST}, incl. the same-net trunk discount
 *                {@link TRUNK_SHARE}) + crossings ({@link CROSS_DETOUR}). The
 *                route's SHAPE. A PARALLEL overlap (worse than a crossing) is
 *                avoided here, above crossings.
 *   2. `lead`  = {@link LEAD_COST} for turning inside a pin's lead zone.
 *   3. `fork`  = number of corners that DON'T land on a junction a sibling of the
 *                same net already turned at. Minimising it co-locates a fan-out's
 *                branch points so a net splits at ONE shared T-junction instead of
 *                slightly-offset stair-steps (§ below).
 *
 * Perpendicular crossings are invisible to lane separation (which only penalises
 * PARALLEL overlap), so they are priced INTO `hard` at {@link CROSS_DETOUR} px
 * each. Being a weight rather than its own tier is what lets a wire pay a short
 * detour — stepping under a gate body instead of threading over it — to unthread
 * itself; capping that weight below `TURN_COST` is what stops it from ever buying
 * a corner. It also still breaks ties between two elbows that match on length and
 * turns, which a strict tier did, and does so ABOVE `lead` by construction.
 * Greedy per wire (a later wire avoids the ones already laid).
 *
 * `fork` is the LOWEST tier, so co-locating splits is a pure tiebreak: when two
 * branches of a net leave the shared trunk in opposite directions, A* picks —
 * among routes ALREADY tied on shape and lead — the one whose corner sits exactly
 * where the first branch turned. Two 4px-offset risers thus collapse into one
 * clean T (trunk in, one branch up, one down), and the split lands as early as the
 * shared trunk allows (no overshoot past the junction). It can never lengthen a
 * wire, add a corner/crossing, or spend a lead to do so. */
