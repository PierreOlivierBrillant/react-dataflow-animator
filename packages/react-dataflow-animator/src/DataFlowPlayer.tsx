/**
 * Main player: compiles a `spec` into a deterministic timeline and plays it.
 *
 * Since v3 this component is a MOUNT, not a renderer. It creates the
 * framework-agnostic DOM renderer from `@react-dataflow-animator/core` in an
 * effect and tears it down on unmount; React never manages the player's
 * children. That is what makes a frame ~6x cheaper: a clock tick mutates the
 * DOM in place instead of re-rendering a tree.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 *
 *  - **No server markup.** The renderer needs a DOM, so the server emits only
 *    `fallback` (or an empty, correctly-sized box). There is no hydration
 *    mismatch because there is nothing to match.
 *  - **Every option is read once, at mount.** The core reads its options when it
 *    builds; changing any of them — `spec` included — remounts the player. The
 *    current instant and play state are carried across, so this is invisible
 *    while scrubbing or editing a spec.

 * `display: contents` removes the host's own box, so `.rdfa-player` inherits the
