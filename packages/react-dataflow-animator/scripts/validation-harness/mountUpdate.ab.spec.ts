/**
 * Mount-vs-update gate: the retained renderer against ITSELF.
 *
 * Panel A is `mountVanillaStage(spec, t)`. Panel B is mounted at the start of
 * the timeline and walked to the same `t` through the compare grid's
 * checkpoints with `update()`. If retained mode is sound, the two are the same
 * rendering; if `update()` leaves anything behind — a stale style declaration, a
 * head polygon that should have gone, an element in the wrong document position
 * — they are not.
 *
 * WHY THIS GATE EXISTS ALONGSIDE compare.ab.spec.ts. The A/B gate compares the
 * vanilla renderer to React, and it will retire when React stops being the
 * reference at step 2.6. This one involves no React at all: it asserts an
 * internal invariant of the renderer, so it keeps its meaning afterwards. It is
 * also the only gate that exercises `update()` at all — the A/B grid only ever
 * mounts.
 *
 * WHY THE PATH IS CUMULATIVE. A single jump from 0 to `t` would only show that
 * one transition lands correctly. Drift in a retained renderer accumulates over
 * a SEQUENCE of frames, so panel B walks 0 → 25% → 50% → 75% → t, applying every
 * intermediate state before the one under test.
 *
 * WHY THE DOM, NOT THE PIXELS. A normalised `outerHTML` comparison refutes the
 * invariant the instant the two states differ, and says where; a pixel diff only
 * notices once the drift is large enough to move a pixel. The DOM verdict is
 * therefore what this gate asserts, with the pixel ratio recorded beside it as a
 * corroborating signal. See `core/src/dom/normalizeHtml.ts` for exactly what is
 * normalised away (attribute order, declaration order, float precision) and what
 * is not (structure, order, classes, text).
 *
 * NO RATCHET. This gate is born green and there is nothing to ratchet down from.
 * The one class of cell it does not assert on is `midCrossfade`, and that is not
 * a tolerance: it is a documented path dependence of the reference renderer,
 * detected from the spec rather than listed by hand — see the flag's definition
 * in main.tsx.
